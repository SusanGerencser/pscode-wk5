// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd


(start program of choice
obtain numeric value
determine if numeric value is divisible by 2
if yes, print number is even
else, print number is odd)


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


a) ask for five individual numeric values

b) add the five individual numeric values together
divide sum by 5, the is the total amount of numbers, to find the average 
display "The average number is"
display the average as determined

c and d) if the first numeric value is larger than the second numeric value, set max to first number
else, set max to second number
if the third numberic value is larger than current max, set max third numeric value
if the fourth numeric value is higher than current max, set max to fourth numeric value
if the fifth numeric value is higher than current max, set max to fifth numeric value
display "The maximum number is"
display the maximum number as determined

if the first numeric value is smaller than the second numeric value, set min to first number
else, set min to second number
if the third numberic value is smaller than current min, set min third numeric value
if the fourth numeric value is smaller than current min, set min to fourth numeric value
if the fifth numeric value is smaller than current min, set min to fifth numeric value
display "The minimum number is"
display the minimum number as determined
